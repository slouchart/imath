""" TODO List"""

1) Verify thoroughly transtyping between int, PFElement, FFElement and Polynomial for operators add, mul, eq
2) Tidy up the code of PrimeField to get rid of low level functions _pf_*
3) Answer the first item by subclassing PFElement from int and FFElement from Polynomial (branch out the code)
4) Get rid of IntegralDomain class, of Z class to make this module only suitable for finite fields
5) If 1) has been solved, change the signature of gcd and power to remove argument zero and one
6) Measure performance of the code : finite field instantiation and polynomial factorization
