# imath
A pure Python library for finite field arithmetic and polynomial manipulation

## Introduction
imath allows number manipulation from the following sets:
- Gaussian integers
- Prime fields
- Finite fields of dimension 2 and higher

You can also define polynomials whose coefficients are drawn from these sets

The following operations are supported for numbers and polynomials:
- addition and subtraction
- multiplication
- multiplication by a member of the base set (external multiplication as in a vector space)
- exponentiation by a positive integer

Rings (Gaussian integers, Polynomials) support :
- euclidean division a.k.a divmod (// and %)
- GCD

Fields support :
- true division
- Frobenius reciprocal
- floor division (//) and modulo (%) are supported but default respectively to true division(/) and zero

## Usage

###Prime field creation
    
    from imath.primefield import PrimeField
    f2 = PrimeField(2)
    
The integer passed as a parameter must be prime and represents the characteristic of the field.

###Elements of a prime field
In a prime field of characteristic p, the elements are mapped onto the integers in the range [-(p-1)/2.. (p-1)/2]
For instance, the prime field F7 contains -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2 and 3

You can instantiate any element in two ways:

    f7 = PrimeField(7)
    e = f7(-3)
    g = f7.element(2)
    
At this point, all operations are supported using the common operators + - * / **

### Defining a polynomial over a prime field

    from imath.polynomial import Polynomial
    from imath.primefield import PrimeField
    
    p = Polynomial((-1, 0, 1, 1), PrimeField(3))
    
    # or, alternatively:
    p = PrimeField(3).polynomial(-1, 0, 1, 1)
    
### Checking whether a polynomial is irreducible

    assert p.is_irreducible
    
### Symbolic polynomials

    from imath.polyparse import symbolic_polynomial
    p = symbolic_polynomial('X^3 + X^2 - 1', PrimeField(3))
    
    # or, alternatively:
    p = PrimeField(3).parse_poly('X^3 + X^2 - 1')
    
### Creation of a finite field
Finite fields are vector spaces built upon a prime field. For instance, F4 the finite field with 4 elements can be seen as a space vector of dimension 2 over F2, the prime field of characteristic 2.
However, the creation of a finite field involves polynomials. Given an irreducible polynomial P of degree q over a prime field of characteristic p, the quotient set Fp[X]/\<P> of the ring of polynomials over Fp divided by the ideal generated by P is a field of characteristic p with p^q elements
This finite field is a vector space of dimension q over the field Fp

    from imath.finitefield import FiniteField, PrimeField
    from imath.polynomial import Polynomial
    
    f2 = PrimeField(2)
    f4 = FiniteField(2, 2, f2.poly_parse('X^2 + X + 1'))
    
### Elements of a finite field
Elements are defined as coefficients in a vector basis. If w is a root of the irreducible polynomial used in the definition (see above), {1, j, ..., j^(q-1)} is such a vector basis
Therefore, elements of such a field are isomorphic to polynomials over the base prime field up to degree q-1

    e = f4(0, 1)  # the element w
    a = f4(1, 0)  # the element 1
    
In the rest of this document, we use the term 'finite field' to cover both prime fields and finite fields 
    
### Polynomial Factorization
Given a polynomial over a finite field can be factorized into irreducible factors using the Cantor-Zassenhaus algorithm

    f3 = PrimeField(3)
    p = symbolic_polynomial('-X^4 + X - 1', f3)
    factors, constant_term = factorize(p).cantor_zassenhaus()
    for factor in factors:
        print(factor)
